        <p style="margin-top: -80px; width: 600px; color: #12E1B9">Our work at Advocato is to achieve one purpose: make things that aren't serving communities effectively, better.
        Initially starting as a project idea for the United Nation's SDG GameChanger Awards in 2024, we began to realize that we couldn't just stop after one project.
        We could keep making, building, and improving. <br> And that's what we do.</p>
