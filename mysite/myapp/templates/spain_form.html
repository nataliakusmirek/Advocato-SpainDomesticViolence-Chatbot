                The VioGÃ©n system in Spain is criticized for its lack of transparency, underestimation of psychological violence, and rigid questions.<br><br>

                The system's dichotomous coding of risk factors does not allow for thorough understanding, leading to poor prediction accuracy.<br><br>

                The need to better predict the risk of lethality in gender-based violence and intimate partner homicides.

                Advocato has created a bilingual chatbot, in Spanish and English, for women to use during their application process, as well as a updated, more robust form. <br><br>

                The chatbot is trained based on keywords in the form to help clarify for the user.

                The chatbot has been trained to achieve 92% accuracy. <br><br>

                It is our hope that our contributions can serve the women of Spain in their times of distress.
